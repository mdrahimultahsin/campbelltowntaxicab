    "content": "Hybrid vehicles combine a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric motor, resulting in better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The electric motor assists the engine during acceleration, allowing the engine to operate at lower RPMs and consume less fuel. Regenerative braking captures energy that would otherwise be lost, charging the battery while driving. Hybrids offer a smooth and quiet driving experience, especially in stop-and-go traffic, and can significantly reduce environmental impact. Understanding how hybrids work helps drivers appreciate the technology and optimize performance for cost-effective driving."
