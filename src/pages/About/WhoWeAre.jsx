                              Sky Maxi Cabs was started to fill a gap in the Sydney
                              transport market. Passengers wanted affordable group
                              transport with professional drivers and simple booking. We
                              built a fleet that includes sedans, SUVs, 7 seat maxi
                              vans, 11 seat maxi vans, luxury vehicles, and wheelchair
                              accessible taxis. Each vehicle is maintained daily and
                              inspected to meet NSW transport regulations.
